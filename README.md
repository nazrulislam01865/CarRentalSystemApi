The Car Rental System API is a backend service built using .NET Core Web API that manages car rental operations for customers and administrators. It provides endpoints to handle car listings, bookings, user management, and rental transactions. The system ensures smooth management of available vehicles, rental schedules, and customer information.

Key features include:

User Management: Register, login, and manage customer profiles.

Car Management: Add, update, delete, and list available cars with details like make, model, year, and availability.

Booking Management: Customers can book cars for specific dates, and admins can approve, reject, or manage bookings.

Transaction Management: Handles rental payments, billing, and invoices.

Secure API Access: Protects sensitive data and operations using authentication and authorization.

This API follows the RESTful principles, making it easy to integrate with web or mobile applications.
